The Poisson distribution is used to describe the distribution of rare events in a large population.\n","\n","A Poisson distribution:\n","1. Takes only non-negative numbers.\n","2. Is defined by the mean, $\\lambda$.\n","3. Each occurrence is independent of the other occurrences.\n","4. The occurrences in each interval can range from zero to infinity.\n","5. The mean number of occurrences must be constant throughout the experiment.\n","\n","For example, if a variable measures the number of:\n","- Typos on a *printed page*\n","- Patients who enter an emergency room in *one hour*\n","- Customers at a Maybank ATM at Mid Valley Megamall in *10-minute intervals*\n","- Surface defects on a *new refrigerator*\n","- Repairs needed on *10 miles of highway*\n","- Bankruptcies that are filed in *a month*\n","- Arrivals at a car wash in *one hour*\n","- Network failures per *day*\n","- File server virus infection at a data center during a *24-hour period*\n","- Airbus 330 aircraft engine shutdowns per *100,000 flight hours*\n","- Asthma patient arrivals in a *given hour at a walk-in clinic*\n","- Work-related accidents over a *given production time*\n","- Birth, deaths, marriages, divorces, suicides, and homicides over a *given period of time*\n","- Customers who call to complain about a service problem per *month*\n","- Visitors to a web site per *minute*\n","- Calls to consumer hot line in a *5-minute period*\n","- Telephone calls per *minute* in a small business\n","\n","then we say that the variable is Poisson distributed.\n","\n","\n","If a variable is poisson distributed with mean $\\lambda$, its standard deviation will be $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$.

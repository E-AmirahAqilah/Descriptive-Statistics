Introduction <a name=\"introduction\"></a>\n","Statistics is the science of **collecting**, **organizing**, **analyzing**, **interpreting**, and **presenting** data. It helps us convert measurements we gather from the world around us into knowledge in a **systematic** manner to ensure both **consistency** and **reproducibility** of results.\n","\n","![](../images/statistics.png)\n","\n","Our journey begins with the simplest of questions - *\"What would we like to know about a certain group of objects?\"* The objects here can refer to people, animals, buildings, household items, etc. - basically anything that is of interest to us. The grouping of said objects is referred to as a **population**, and our aim is to generalize any results we derive from our investigations to this entire group. Populations are usually defined to encompass the largest possible collection of objects that are of interest in a given study."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NjpwQ6BNSt1r"},"source":["<div class = \"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n","<b>Example</b>\n","<p>\n","1. A researcher wishes to study the happiness levels among students currently undergoing tertiary education. The population defined here would be the set of all university students in Malaysia.\n","<p>\n","2. The Kuala Lumpur City Council (DBKL) is interested in identifying the average household expenditure of families in the Bottom 40% (B40) category under its purview. The population defined here would be the set of all families with household income RM3,000 and below.\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0F3YVLTvSt1r"},"source":["In most cases, the population is so large that collecting data from the entire group becomes **infeasible** (sometimes impossible). For example, suppose that we are interested in the average price of all the 2-bedroom apartments in KL - this population is so large that we cannot study all of it without expending significant effort. In situations such as these, we **collect** data only from a **subgroup** of the population, which we call a **sample**. Ideally, a sample should represent the population well. For instance, a sample of 2-bedroom apartment prices in KL should include apartments from various municipalities to ensure no one part of the city is **under/over-represented**. Further details on populations and samples will be discussed later in this course.\n","\n","Having gathered some data on a problem of interest, our data can then be **organized** easily with the use of spreadsheets or databases. In this course, we will operate on the assumption that the data has been cleaned and organized on flat files (CSV, XLS, etc.) as we wish to *focus on the analysis* of our data and not the logistics behind how we store it.\n","\n","The first step of **analyzing** data is to **explore** it - this involves examining the type of data we've collected, how it behaves, and summarize our findings. This process is called **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and is one of the most crucial steps to understanding our data.\n","\n","Using said findings, we can employ probability and estimation to make generalizations about the population based on our sample. This process is called **inference**, and it represents the culmination of the analysis stage. Inference allows us to use the data collected via a sample to model the behavior of the entire population, e.g. using customer product reviews to determine what product features are in demand.\n","\n","Last but not least, we **interpret** and **present** our data with appropriate visual aids. Interpretation often calls for domain-specific knowledge, which is subject to the context of our study. As always, it is best to let the data do the talking and that's precisely where **visualization** comes in.\n","\n","The diagram below gives an overview of what is commonly known as **the big picture** of statistics. It represents the 3 core processes, which are producing/procuring data, exploratory analysis, and inference. Used well, statistics forms a powerful tool which can reap benefits for business decision making.\n","\n","![](../images/BigPic.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ab2_ZA5wSt1s"},"source":["### A.
